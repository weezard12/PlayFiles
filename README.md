A WPF application for opening media files, YouTube videos, or websites at a specific time.
Credit to Davidnos for the idea, he asked me for an app similar to Windows Task Scheduler, but simpler and more user-friendly. In my opinion, this app does exactly that and even more.
The app uses a custom media window to play the files/URLs and can even integrate with VLC Media Player if it's installed.
The UI isn't the best, and it's because it was created at a time that I didn't know how to use the WPF XAML that well. However, it's really practical and straightforward.
## Features
- [x] Easy to use.
- [x] Can play media files / websits at specific times.

- Option to keep the screen on when the app is open (disable screen power save)
